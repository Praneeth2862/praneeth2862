## 🚀 Featured Projects

### [Digital-Diary](https://github.com/Praneeth2862/Digital-Diary-Website-Project)
Digital Diary is a platform that enables users to create, manage, and store their daily diary entries online. The core technologies we used for this project include PHP, MySQL, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
The primary features of Digital Diary include:

User Authentication: Users can register accounts with a username and password. Once registered, they can securely log in to access their diary entries.

Diary Entry Management: Users can create new diary entries, view existing entries, edit them for updates, or delete entries they no longer need. Each entry contains a title, date, and content.

User Experience: We focused on creating an intuitive and user-friendly interface, implementing form validation to guide users, and ensuring data privacy by allowing users to manage only their own diary entries.
